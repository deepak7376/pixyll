### 1. Introduction
Training a machine learning model is a very time-consuming task. As datasets size increases, it becomes very hard to train models within a limited time frame. To solve this type of problem, distributed training approaches are used. Using distributed training, we can train very large models and speed up training time. Tensorflow provides a high-end API to train your models in a distributed way with minimal code changes.

### 2. Types of Paradigms
Two types of paradigms used for distributed training.

1. **Data parallelism**: In data parallelism, models are replicated into different devices (GPU) and trained on batches of data.
2. **Model parallelism**: When models are too large to fit on a single device then it can be distributed over many devices.

### 3. Synch vs. Asynch training
There are two common ways of distributing training with data parallelism.

**Synch training (supported via all-reduce architecture)**: All devices (GPUs) train over different slices of input data in sync and aggregating gradient at each step.there are three common strategies comes under sync training
**Async Training (supported via parameter server architecture)**: all workers are independently training over the input data and updating variables asynchronously.

### 4. Types of distributed strategy
1. **Mirrored Strategy**
- Worked on one machine/ worker and multiple GPUs
- The model (neural network architecture) is replicated across all GPUs
- Each model is trained on different slices of data and weight updating is done using efficient cross-device communication algorithms (all-reduce algorithms) such as Hierarchical copy, reduction to one device, NCCL (default).

|Fig.2 - Operations of Mirrored Strategy with two GPU devices.|

As you see in the figure is that a neural network having two layers (layer A, layer B) are replicated on each GPUs. Each GPU is trained on a slice of data, during the backpropagation cross-device communication algorithm is used to update the weights.

2. **TPU Strategy**

- TPU strategy is the same as mirrored strategy, the only difference is that it runs on TPUs instead of GPUs
- Distributed training architecture is also the same as a mirrored strategy.

3. **Multiworker Mirrored Strategy**

- The model is trained across multiple machines having multiple GPUs
- Workers are run in lock-step and synchronizing the gradient at each step
- Either ring all-reduce or hierarchical all-reduce communication used for cross-device communication.

4. **Central Storage Strategy**

- Performed on one machine with multiple GPUs
- Variables are not mirrored instead, they are placed on the CPU and operations are replicated all local GPUs.

5. **One Device Strategy**

- Run-on a single device GPU or CPU
- Typical for testing
6. **Parameter Server Strategy**

- Implemented on multiple machines
- In this setup, some machines are designated as workers and some as parameter servers
- Each variable of the model is placed on one parameter server
- Computation is replicated across all GPUs of all the workers.
- Worker tasks are read input, variables, compute forward and backward and send updates to the parameters servers.

### 5. Conclusion
You shouldn’t always distribute. Smaller models can train faster on one machine. When you have a lot of data and your data size and your model continue to grow, in that case, you can go with distributed training approaches.
