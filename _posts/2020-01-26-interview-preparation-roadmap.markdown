### Week 1-2: Fundamentals & Problem-Solving

**Software Engineering:**
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Backtracking.
- **LeetCode/ HackerRank:** Solve easy and medium-level problems. Aim for at least 3 problems daily.

**ML Engineering:**
- **Math Basics:** Linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics.
- **ML Fundamentals:** Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning, Overfitting/Underfitting, Bias-Variance Tradeoff.
- **Coding:** Implement basic algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression).

### Week 3-4: Advanced Topics & System Design

**Software Engineering:**
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Graph algorithms, DP on trees, Segment Trees, Trie.
- **System Design:** Learn about scalability, load balancing, caching, databases, microservices. Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann.
- **LeetCode/HackerRank:** Solve medium and hard-level problems. Aim for at least 2 problems daily.

**ML Engineering:**
- **Advanced ML Concepts:** Deep learning, CNNs, RNNs, NLP basics.
- **Projects:** Work on one or two significant projects demonstrating ML skills (e.g., Kaggle competitions, custom projects).
- **System Design:** Understand ML system design concepts, model deployment, monitoring.

### Week 5-6: Mock Interviews & Review

**Software Engineering:**
- **Mock Interviews:** Use platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io for mock interviews.
- **Review:** Revisit weaker topics, solve previous interview questions, and conduct mock system design interviews.
- **Behavioral Questions:** Prepare answers for common behavioral questions. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

**ML Engineering:**
- **Mock Interviews:** Practice with peers or use interview prep platforms.
- **Review Projects:** Ensure your projects are well-documented and you can explain every detail.
- **Behavioral Questions:** Prepare for questions on project experiences, teamwork, and challenges.

### Daily Routine:

- **Morning (2 hours):** Coding practice.
- **Afternoon (2 hours):** Study theoretical concepts (Data Structures, Algorithms, ML theory).
- **Evening (2 hours):** Work on projects, system design practice, or mock interviews.
- **Night (1 hour):** Review and consolidate learning, work on behavioral questions.

### Resources:

- **Books:** "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop.
- **Online Courses:** Coursera, edX, Udacity for ML courses; AlgoExpert, LeetCode for coding.
- **YouTube Channels:** TechLead, Computerphile, 3Blue1Brown.

Consistency and regular practice are key. Stay focused, and you'll be well-prepared for your interviews. Good luck!
